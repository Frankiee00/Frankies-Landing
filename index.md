# Welcome to Frankie's Page

Hello, I am Frankie a first-year transfer student at UCSD. [Here](https://github.com/Frankiee00) is a link to my github page, which includes several projects that I have done as an individual.

I picked Computer Science as a major, because of my interest in coding and understanding the workings of everything we use in today's world. The options are limitless with Computer Science and I love having that option. I look forward to this class!

## Interests

### Interest 1 - Soccer

One of my main interests in my life is soccer, I called it Futbol. I played it growing up as a kid and played at the collegiate level. My favorite player is **[Neymar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar)**, due to his incredible technical skills. My favorite team as a whole is **[FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/)**, due to their style of play and famously stamping their mark in history with the beautiful style of play of Tiki-Taka. 

### Interest 2 - Reading

Besides, coding and soccer, I throughly do enjoy _reading books_ which are several categories, such as personal fianace, self-help, **_philosophy_**, etc. One of my favorite books is [Ego is The Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/Ego-Enemy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/1591847818), by Ryan Holiday. I do recommend to read this book as it speaks about humans biggest enemy, ego, and how it can be our demise. As well as, once we learn to combat this ego, we can truly achieve self-fulfillment.
